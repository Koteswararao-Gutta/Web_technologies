<h1><h1>By Koteswararao Gutta and Burra Sai Krishna Bharadwaj</h1></h1>

<article>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Cyberbullying is a growing concern on social media platforms, where users can hide behind anonymity and engage in harmful behavior. Mainly we study,  propose a hybrid technique for identifying cyberbullying using various different algorithms. We evaluate the performance of 11 different algorithms, including Logistic Regression, MLP Classifier, SGD Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bagging Classifier. Our experiments show that Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier achieve the highest accuracy of 90.72% and 90.66% respectively, while Naive Bayes has the lowest accuracy of 56.63%. Our hybrid approach combines multiple machine learning algorithms to increasing precision and robustness of identifying cyberbullying. use a feature extraction technique to take the text input and extract pertinent characteristics, after which to train the machine learning models using these features. Our results demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can effectively detect cyberbullying on social media platforms, and our hybrid approach can provide a more comprehensive and accurate solution for identifying and preventing cyberbullying incidents.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>As social media usage continues to rise, so does the prevalence of cyberbullying - a form of online harassment that can have devastating effects on its victims. Detecting cyberbullying on such a vast platform can be a challenging task, as it requires distinguishing between derogatory, provocative, or sensitive messages from genuine conversations. Machine learning techniques have been used more frequently in recent years to automate this process, but they are not without their limitations. False detections are still a common occurrence, and it can be challenging to distinguish between general profanity and hate speech. Certainly. One real example of cyberbullying that received widespread attention is the case of Kangana Ranaut, an actress and comedian who starred in the 2016 all-female Ghostbusters film. Kangana was the target of a coordinated campaign of harassment on Twitter, which included racist and sexist insults, as well as the posting of her personal information and explicit photos.
  Kangana received a barrage of abusive tweets, causing her to temporarily leave Twitter due to the overwhelming negativity. The cyberbullying campaign against her sparked widespread outrage and led to a discussion about the toxicity of social media and the need to take action to prevent cyberbullying. In this case, Kangana Ranaut is the victim of cyberbullying. The abusive tweets and messages sent to her caused her emotional distress and anxiety. The perpetrators of the cyberbullying campaign used Twitter as a platform to harass and intimidate Kangana, causing her to feel unsafe and attacked. The campaign also had a negative impact on the broader community, as it highlighted the need for greater awareness and action to prevent cyberbullying. Overall, the case of Kangana Ranaut demonstrates the harmful effects of cyberbullying and the need for individuals, venues for social media and society at large to take steps to prevent it. It is important to recognize that Cyberbullying is a significant issue that can negatively impact a victim's mental health and general wellbeing. Regardless of age, gender, or background, anyone can fall victim to cyberbullying on social media, messaging apps, or online forums. It is important for both individuals and organizations to take proactive steps to prevent cyberbullying and support those who have been affected by it. This can involve promoting responsible online behavior and safety, promptly reporting instances of cyberbullying, and providing resources such as counseling for those who have experienced emotional distress or anxiety as a result of it.
 	     In order to overcome these difficulties, we provide a hybrid method for identifying cyberbullying in this research article. Our strategy involves leveraging a manually annotated open-source dataset to apply several supervised classification techniques to user-provided inputs. We conduct a systematic assessment of the literature on cyberbullying detection methods, looking at techniques for identifying hate speech in social media while separating it from other types of vulgarity. By utilizing different algorithms, For this purpose, we seek to establish lexical baselines. Our hybrid approach aims to increase the precision and effectiveness of cyberbullying identification and minimize the risk of false detections. By identifying and addressing the shortcomings of current approaches.

  <h2>Literature survey</h2>
  <p>IoT has a multidisciplinary vision to provide its beneft to several domains such as 
environmental, industrial, public/private, medical, transportation etc. Diferent 
researchers have explained the IoT diferently with respect to specifc interests and 
aspects. Te potential and power of IoT can be seen in several application domains. 
Figure 2 illustrates few of the application domains of IoTs potentials.
Various important IoT projects have taken charge over the market in last few years. 
Some of the important IoT projects that have captured most of the market are shown 
in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, a global distribution of these IoT projects is shown among American, European and Asia/Pacifc region. It can be seen that American continent are 
contributing more in the health care and smart supply chain projects whereas contribution of European continent is more in the smart city projects .t is evident 
that industry, smart city, smart energy and smart vehicle based IoT projects have a big 
market share in comparison to others.
Smart city is one of the trendy application areas of IoT that incorporates smart homes 
as well. Smart home consists of IoT enabled home appliances, air-conditioning/heating system, television, audio/video streaming devices, and security systems which are 
communicating with each other in order to provide best comfort, security and reduced 
energy consumption. All this communication takes place through IoT based central 
control unit using Internet. Te concept of smart city gained popularity in the last decade and attracted a lot of research activities [9]. Te smart home business economy is 
about to cross the 100 billion dollars by 2022 [10]. Smart home does not only provide 
the in-house comfort but also benefts the house owner in cost cutting in several aspects 
i.e. low energy consumption will results in comparatively lower electricity bill. Besides 
smart homes, another category that comes within smart city is smart vehicles. Modern 
cars are equipped with intelligent devices and sensors that control most of the components from the headlights of the car to the engine [11].[8]..</p>

  <h2>IoT architecture and technologies</h2>
  <p>e IoT architecture consists of fve important layers that defnes all the functionalities of IoT systems. Tese layers are perception layer, network layer, middleware 
layer, application layer, business layer. At the bottom of IoT architecture, perception 
layer exists that consists of physical devices i.e. sensors, RFID chips, barcodes etc. 
and other physical objects connected in IoT network. Tese devices collects information in order to deliver it to the network layer. Network layer works as a transmission medium to deliver the information from perception layer to the information 
processing system. Tis transmission of information may use any wired/wireless 
medium along with 3G/4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc. Next level layer is known as middleware layer. Te main task of this layer is to process the information received from 
the network layer and make decisions based on the results achieved from ubiquitous 
computing. Next, this processed information is used by application layer for global 
device management. On the top of the architecture, there is a business layer which 
control the overall IoT system, its applications and services. Te business layer visualizes the information and statistics received from the application layer and further 
used this knowledge to plan future targets and strategies. Furthermore, the IoT architectures can be modifed according to the need and application domain [19, 20, 37]. 
Besides layered framework, IoT system consists of several functional blocks that supports various IoT activities such as sensing mechanism, authentication and identifcation, control and management [38]. Figure 6 illustrates such functional blocks of IoT 
architecture.
Tere are several important functional blocks responsible for I/O operations, connectivity issues, processing, audio/video monitoring and storage management. All these 
functional block together incorporates an efcient IoT system which are important for 
optimum performance. Although, there are several reference architectures proposed 
with the technical specifcations, but these are still far from the standard architecture 
that is suitable for global IoT [39]. Terefore, a suitable architecture is still needsvk to be 
designed that could satisfy the global IoT needs. Te generic working structure of IoT 
system is shown in Fig. 7. Figure 7 shows a dependency of IoT on particular application 
parameters. IoT gateways have an important role in IoT communication as it allows connectivity between IoT servers and IoT devices related to several applications [40]..</p>
